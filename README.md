# Slides for SF Python Meetup

This is a talk intended to give some hints on moving to microservices, to be given at the 2019-10-09 SF Python Meetup at Checkr.

I used the [vscode-reveal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evilz.vscode-reveal) plugin to manage my slides. Actual slides are in `slides.md`.
