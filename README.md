# Slides for SF Python Meetup

This is a talk intended to give some hints on moving to microservices, to be given at the 2019-10-09 SF Python Meetup at Checkr.

I used the [vscode-reveal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evilz.vscode-reveal) plugin to manage my slides. Actual slides are in [`slides.md`](slides.md).

Diagrams were done in [Monodraw](https://monodraw.helftone.com), I'm not nearly silly enough to do that kind of text art by hand.
